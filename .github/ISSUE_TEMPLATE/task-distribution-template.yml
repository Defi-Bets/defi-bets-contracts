Certainly! Here's an example of a task distribution template in YAML format that you can use for GitHub:

```yaml
name: Task Distribution
about: Use this template to distribute new tasks among team members

title: "[Task]"

body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ## Task Description

        <!-- Provide a brief description of the task that needs to be completed -->

        ## Task Details

        <!-- Provide detailed information about the task, including steps to reproduce or specific requirements -->

        ## Acceptance Criteria

        <!-- Outline the specific criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete -->

        - [ ] Criterion 1
        - [ ] Criterion 2
        - [ ] Criterion 3

        ## Additional Information

        <!-- Add any additional context or information that may be helpful for completing the task -->

        ## Assignees

        <!-- Tag the team members who will be responsible for completing the task -->

        @assignee1
        @assignee2
        @assignee3
```

To use this template, save it as a YAML file, such as `task-distribution-template.yml`, and add it to the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory in your GitHub repository. When creating a new issue, select the "Task Distribution" template, fill in the details, assign team members, and track the progress of tasks within your repository.
